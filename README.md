# Tailwind CSS Gradient Bug

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Tailwind CSS related to gradient rendering.  The bug occurs when there's a typo or missing class in the gradient definition, leading to unexpected or incomplete rendering.

The `bug.html` file shows the problematic code, while `solution.html` provides the corrected version.

**Bug:**
Incorrect or missing class names in the gradient definition can cause the gradient to render incorrectly or not at all. Overuse of gradients also affects accessibility.

**Solution:**
Double-check all class names used in the gradient definition. Ensure all classes are correctly defined in your Tailwind configuration. Consider alternatives to gradients if they are not essential or if they negatively impact accessibility.
