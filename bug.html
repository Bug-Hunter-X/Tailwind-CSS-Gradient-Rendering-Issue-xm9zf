```html
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-4">
  <!-- Content here -->
</div>
```
This code uses Tailwind CSS's gradient feature.  However, if the `to-purple-500` class is not defined or is misspelled, it will cause an unexpected rendering.  The browser might ignore the gradient entirely or render only the `from-blue-500` portion.

Another potential issue is the overuse of gradients, which can hurt accessibility and readability.
