```html
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-4">
  <!-- Content here -->
</div>
```
This corrected code ensures that the `to-purple-500` class is correctly defined and used.  If you encounter issues, review your Tailwind CSS configuration to ensure all necessary classes are available.  For better accessibility, consider using solid colors unless the gradient is absolutely necessary.
